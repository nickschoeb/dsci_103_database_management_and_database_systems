DSCI 103 - Database Management and Database Systems

This is a public repo for:

Students of Nick Schoeb enrolled at Harford Community College in DSCI 103 - Database Management and Database Systems.

This is primarily intended as another way to access code samples used in the course.

Note to students, this should make it easier to read and copy lecture code samples than the format provided in the LMS. I also intend to leave this up as long as possible so you can reference it long after you leave the course.

These are examples for use with MySQL Community Edition version 8.x
